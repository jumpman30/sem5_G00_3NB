## Level 2 - Container Diagram:

  * The Container diagram delves into the high-level architecture of the system by breaking it down into containers (e.g., web servers, databases, microservices).
  * It illustrates the major containers that make up the system and their relationships.
  * Each container can represent a major functional component of the system, such as a web application, a mobile app, or a database.
